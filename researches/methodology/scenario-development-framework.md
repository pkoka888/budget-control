# Scenario Development Framework

## Framework Overview
This document outlines the systematic approach for developing practical user scenarios that validate the AI-powered personal assistant's value proposition. The framework transforms abstract features into concrete, measurable user outcomes.

## Scenario Development Methodology

### Phase 1: User Research & Profiling
```
User Archetype Development:
1. Demographic profiling (age, location, profession, income)
2. Financial situation assessment (income, expenses, debts, savings)
3. Life stage evaluation (single, family, career stage)
4. Risk tolerance and goals identification
5. Technology adoption level assessment
```

### Phase 2: Problem Identification
```
Pain Point Analysis:
1. Current financial challenges and frustrations
2. Traditional solution limitations
3. Desired outcomes and success metrics
4. Risk factors and constraints
5. Czech market specific considerations
```

### Phase 3: Solution Mapping
```
Feature-to-Need Alignment:
1. Map user problems to assistant capabilities
2. Identify Month 1-4 feature integration points
3. Define measurable outcome improvements
4. Establish timeline and milestone expectations
5. Validate Czech market relevance
```

### Phase 4: Scenario Construction
```
Comprehensive Scenario Structure:
1. User profile and financial context
2. Current situation and traditional response
3. AI assistant personalized response
4. Implementation feature utilization
5. Quantitative impact assessment
6. Best practices and user feedback
```
