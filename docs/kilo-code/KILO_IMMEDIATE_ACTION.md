# 🚀 Kilo Code - Immediate Action Plan

**Status**: You're experiencing edit errors. We've fixed this before - let's do it again!

**Goal**: Get you unblocked RIGHT NOW and working productively

---

## ⚡ TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

You're getting edit errors? **Stop what you're doing.**

1. **Close** any XML-based diff attempts
2. **Open** `KILO_CODE_EDIT_HELP.md`
3. **Read** the "Proven Workflow" section
4. **Follow** the Read → Edit → Verify steps
5. **Work** on Task K-6.2 implementation
6. **Ask** Claude if anything breaks

---

## 🎯 What's Happening

**Problem**: You tried to use apply_diff with XML
**Result**: Edit errors and blocking
**Solution**: Use Read → Edit → Verify instead (proven 100% reliable)

---

## ✅ The Working Workflow

### THREE SIMPLE STEPS

#### Step 1: READ
```
Use the Read tool to view the file
Copy the EXACT code you want to change
Include surrounding context
```

#### Step 2: EDIT
```
Use the Edit tool with:
  - old_string: Exactly what you copied from Read
  - new_string: The improved version with your changes
Paste, don't type
```

#### Step 3: VERIFY
```
Use Read tool again
Check your changes are there
Confirm formatting is correct
Done!
```

## 🎓 Why This Works

- ✅ No XML parsing
- ✅ No special formatting
- ✅ Just copy-paste
- ✅ 100% reliable
- ✅ You've done this before

## 📋 Your Current Task

**Task**: K-6.2 Goal Progress Tracking
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**What to do**: Add 3 methods to GoalService.php

**Documentation**:
- `KILO_K62_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Step-by-step guide
- `KILO_CODE_EDIT_HELP.md` - How to use Read → Edit → Verify

---

## 🔧 Quick Start: Right Now

### Action 1: Stop the XML approach
Don't use apply_diff XML - it doesn't work for our needs

### Action 2: Read the help docs
- Open: `KILO_CODE_EDIT_HELP.md`
- Read: The workflow section

### Action 3: Start Task K-6.2
- Open: `KILO_K62_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- Read: Step 1 (Read the file)

### Action 4: Follow the workflow
- Step 1: Read GoalService.php
- Step 2: Identify where to add code
- Step 3: Use Edit tool
- Step 4: Verify with Read
- Step 5: Submit to Claude

---

## 🛠️ The Edit Tool Usage

### Format:
```
Tool: Edit
file_path: /full/path/to/file.php
old_string: [Exact code from Read - copy this exactly]
new_string: [Your improved version]
```

### Key Points:
- ✅ Copy from Read output exactly
- ✅ Include surrounding code for context
- ✅ Make old_string unique (no duplicates in file)
- ✅ Keep indentation exact
- ✅ Verify immediately after

## 💡 Key Reminders

### Remember This:
```
Read → Edit → Verify WORKS 100% OF THE TIME
when done correctly
```

### Don't Do This:
```
❌ Try to use XML-based apply_diff
❌ Type code manually (use copy-paste)
❌ Change multiple files at once
❌ Try to edit without Reading first
```

### Do This Instead:
```
✅ Use Read tool first
✅ Use Edit tool with exact code
✅ Verify with Read immediately after
✅ Work on one task at a time
✅ Ask for help if stuck
```
