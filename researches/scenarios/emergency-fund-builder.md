EMERGENCY FUND ANALYSIS:

Current Emergency Fund: 25,000 CZK (0.8 months coverage)
Target Emergency Fund: 96,000 CZK (3 months expenses)

CRISIS RISK: HIGH 🔴
- 2-week job loss would exhaust savings immediately

Your emergency fund goal of 96,000 CZK is 26% complete. At current savings rate, you'll reach it in 8 months.
