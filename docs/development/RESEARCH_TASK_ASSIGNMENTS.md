# Research Task Assignments: Kilo Code vs Cline

**Date:** 2025-11-11
**Assignment Strategy:** Odd numbers (1,3,5,...) → Kilo Code | Even numbers (2,4,6,...) → Cline

## Overview

Based on the comprehensive research review in `RESEARCH_REVIEW_AND_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, we've identified key research areas for Phase 2 and beyond. Tasks are assigned alternately to ensure balanced workload and complementary expertise.

### Assignment Logic
- **Kilo Code**: Focus on core technical research (LLM integration, performance optimization, mobile feasibility)
- **Cline**: Focus on ecosystem expansion (banking APIs, security enhancements, user experience)

## Task Assignments

### Kilo Code Tasks (Odd Numbers)

#### Task 1: LLM Financial Tutor Research (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
- **Status:** Ready to start
- **Deliverables:** Model comparison, technical architecture, implementation roadmap
- **Why Kilo:** Core technical integration requiring deep coding expertise

#### Task 3: Performance Optimization Research (LOW PRIORITY - Only if needed)
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
- **Status:** On hold until performance issues arise
- **Deliverables:** Performance baseline, bottleneck analysis, optimization plan
- **Why Kilo:** Requires deep technical analysis and code optimization skills

#### Task 5: Mobile App Feasibility Research (PHASE 3+)
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
- **Status:** Future research
- **Deliverables:** User survey, technical comparison, cost analysis
- **Why Kilo:** Technical architecture decision requiring coding expertise

### Cline Tasks (Even Numbers)

#### Task 2: Czech Banking API Research (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
- **Status:** Ready to start
- **Deliverables:** Bank support matrix, import specifications, technical design

## Research Coordination

### Communication Protocol
1. Each researcher creates their own research branch: `research/task-{number}-{name}`
2. Daily progress updates in research-specific channels
3. Weekly checkpoints with full team
4. Final deliverables reviewed by both researchers

### Quality Standards
- All research follows the methodology from `RESEARCH_REVIEW_AND_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- Deliverables must include success criteria validation
- Technical recommendations must be implementable
- Cost analysis required for all proposals

### Success Metrics
- **Task 1 (Kilo)**: Working LLM prototype with Budget Control integration
- **Task 2 (Cline)**: Support for 3+ Czech banks with unified import
- **Task 3 (Kilo)**: 50k+ transaction performance optimization (if needed)
- **Task 4 (Cline)**: Enterprise-grade security roadmap
- **Task 5 (Kilo)**: Clear mobile strategy recommendation
- **Task 6 (Cline)**: UX improvements implemented in v1.1

## Next Steps

1. **Kilo Code**: Start Task 1 (LLM Financial Tutor) immediately
2. **Cline**: Start Task 2 (Czech Banking API) immediately
3. **Both**: Review assigned tasks and confirm understanding
4. **Weekly**: Status updates and coordination meetings
5. **Monthly**: Full research review and integration planning
